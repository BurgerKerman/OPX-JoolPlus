# OPX-JoolPlus

The first instalment in the Outer Planets eXpansion project, JoolPlus is a mod intending to expand the experience offered at the famous jovian planet of Jool. The mod offers a brand new texture for Jool itself, rescaled lunar orbits, and three brand new orbiting bodies each with full biome support. 

Dependencies:
- Kopernicus (obviously)
  - VertexMitchellNetravaliHeightMap bundled
- ModuleManager
Recommended:
- Outer Planets Mod - adds things beyond Jool to visit, also required for OPX-JoolPlus's sister mods
- Janet's Minor Planets - made by my friend and recurring collaborator, Interplanet Janet, and adds (among other things) two Joolian trojans which fit into the artistic style of this mod very well.
Compatible:
- Distant Object Enhancement - full compatibility supported, with colors coded in for each new object.
- More to come...

List of changes:
- Jool recieves a new saturnian texture and a sparse, thin ring system
- Meto, an analog for the inner moon Metis, is present near the inner edge of these rings
- Alnes, an analog for Amalthea, orbits just outside them
- Laythe, Vall, and Tylo are moved outwards to make room for Meto and Alnes and also because quite frankly Laythe is too close for comfort anyway.
- Laythe, Vall, Tylo, and Bop are resized downwards for realism purposes. Tylo was always too damn big.
- Klip, an analog for Callisto is added, its battered surface covered in a total of nineteen biomes to explore. Klip was designed to offer a fun challenge for rover enjoyers.
- Bop is substantially smaller, and now orbits as a trojan moon of Klip. Now its easier to visit, resulting it it actually being visited ever.
- Pol is much, much more distant, at a position akin to the outer minor moon of Themisto. I could have put it farther out but I want people to visit the thing without it being hopelessly destabilized.
