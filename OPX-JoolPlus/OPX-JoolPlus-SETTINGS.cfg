//EXPLANATIONS
//BopTrojan - defaults to true, places Bop in Klip's L5 point. If set to false, Bop's position is in the far outer Jool system as an irregular outer moon.
//CloverJoolRetextureOverride - defaults to false, does nothing if Clover's jool retexture is not also installed.
//if Clover's JoolRetexture is installed, setting this to true allows his jool texture to supersede my own. Aditel will be present regardless.
