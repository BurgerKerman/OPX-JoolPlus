		BetterJool = Well... Guys, we discovered Jool, a big kerb... planet, gas planet.
    		Meto = I think I've gone blind from all the squinting it took to find this thing.
    		Alnes = Reminds me of the disappointment we all felt when we found that Duna wasn't snacks
    		Klip = Well that's a lot of craters. This'll be fun for someone else to explore.
      		Palloocus = Strange... a little white speck not far behind Jool, bright enough that we could see it. Let's call this Palloocus, in honor of the late king.
		Palloomus = A red object here? Wow. Perhaps we should call this Palloomus, after Palloocus' brother.
		Euribanne = It's a teeny asteroid running ahead of Jool. Perhaps this should be called Euribanne, after Jool's father.
		Eurbon = A cute little moon around that asteroid, we see? Something to help the mother of running around... perhaps the famous Eurbon Kerman could use a dedication.
